# Protocol modeling task

Model the protocol described below and analyze it. You may use any method
(Lean 4, Tamarin, Verifpal, or a combination of them). Deliverables follow the
task README: `verdict.json`, an attack report when a goal fails, and
machine-checkable evidence in your chosen tool.

**No model is provided.** You decide the strategy: formalize the whole protocol
first, or reason about the likely flaw and then prove it. The security goals you
must formulate should cover, at minimum: da_soundness, commitment_binding.

## Protocol: Ceramic

**Category:** da

### Overview

Ceramic is a production on-chain da protocol. Its deployed interfaces, message/transaction formats and parameters are the ground truth for this task; consult the protocol's documentation, deployment addresses and incident reports as needed.

### Roles

See the overview.

### Security goals (formulate each as a theorem/lemma)

| # | Goal name | Property |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | `da_soundness` | A commitment is accepted only when the data is available under the sampling/attestation rules. |
| 2 | `commitment_binding` | The commitment binds the exact erasure-coded data. |

### Threat model

Adversary controls a bounded fraction of validators and may withhold data.

### What to decide

Whether the goals hold for the deployed protocol as described. If a goal
fails, produce a concrete sequence of on-chain transactions/messages (an
attack trace) and the resulting violation. If you can, back it with a
machine-checked proof in your chosen tool.
